# Technical Writing for Data Science
ENGRD/QTM302W -- Fall 2023

This course introduces methods of rhetorical analysis to facilitate the interpretation and conveyance of quantitative information and methods for a variety of audiences, ranging from professional researchers to the lay public. Strategies for communicating via text, speech, visuals, and gestures spring from work in a variety of fields and can help in the preparation of genres like research reports, informative and persuasive infographics, technical instructions, translations, and user-selected or user-generated data sets. We will explore a variety of communication platforms as we attend carefully to information design and the possibilities for developing narratives and conveying stories using quantitative data.
